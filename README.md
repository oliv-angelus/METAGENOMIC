A repository containing a collection of scripts to automate and streamline shotgun metagenomics analysis workflows.

## üìñ About This Project

This project provides a suite of scripts designed to handle various stages of a metagenomic analysis pipeline, with tailored workflows for both Illumina (short-read) and Oxford Nanopore (long-read) sequencing data. The tools are built to manage the unique characteristics of each data type and can be adapted for hybrid assembly approaches. The pipeline covers all critical steps, from the initial quality control of raw reads to the final annotation and classification of high-quality Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs). The goal is to create a modular, reproducible, and easy-to-use toolkit for researchers.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Technologies

The scripts and workflows in this repository are built using the following technologies:

* **Languages:**
    * `Shell (Bash)`
    * `Python`
    * `R`

* **Environment Management:**
    * `Conda` and `Mamba` are used for robust and reproducible dependency management, ensuring that all tools run in a consistent environment.

## üî¨ Key Bioinformatic Tools

This repository leverages a range of standard and state-of-the-art bioinformatic tools, which are orchestrated by the scripts. The core tools utilized include:

#### **Quality Control**
* **FastQC**: Raw read quality assessment for illumina reads.
* **NanoPlot**: Raw read quality assessment for nanopore reads.
* **Fastp**: For trimming illumina reads.
* **Filtlong**: For trimming nanopore reads.
* **MultiQC**: Aggregates reports from multiple tools into a single HTML file.

#### **Assembly & Assessment**
* **MEGAHIT**: A fast and memory-efficient metagenome assembler for illumina reads.
* **Flye**: An assembler for long and noisy reads (useful for hybrid assembly), here we use for nanopore reads using -meta parameter.
* **Quast**: Evaluates the quality of genome assemblies.

#### **Metagenomic Binning**
* **MetaBAT2**: A tool for binning assembled contigs into MAGs based on sequence composition and coverage (i preffer this one).
* **MaxBin2**: Another popular tool for binning contigs.
* **CONCOCT**: Bins contigs using sequence composition and coverage across multiple samples.
* **SemiBin**: A semi-supervised tool that leverages deep learning for binning.

#### **Bin Refinement & Selection**
* **DAS Tool**: An automated method for selecting and refining the best set of bins from multiple binning tools.

#### **MAG Quality Assessment**
* **CheckM2**: The current standard for assessing the completeness and contamination of MAGs using a machine learning model.

#### **Gene Prediction & Functional Annotation**
* **Prodigal**: A fast and accurate gene prediction tool for microbial genomes.
* **eggNOG-mapper**: A tool for fast functional annotation of proteins.

#### **Taxonomic Classification**
* **Kraken2**: A k-mer-based tool for assigning taxonomic labels to sequences.
* **Bracken**: Estimates species/genus abundance from Kraken2 reports.

#### **Read Mapping & Coverage**
* **Minimap2**: A fast sequence mapper for DNA and mRNA sequences.
* **SAMtools**: A suite of tools for interacting with high-throughput sequencing data.
* **CoverM**: A tool for calculating coverage of contigs or genomes.

#### **Phylogenetic Analysis**
* **MAFFT**: A multiple sequence alignment program.
* **FastTree**: Infers approximately-maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees from alignments.
